# Python Inheritance Project

This project is part of the Holberton School Higher Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on object-oriented programming in Python, specifically on the concept of inheritance.

## Project Description

In this project, we explore various aspects of inheritance in Python, including:

- Creating and using base classes
- Implementing subclasses
- Method overriding
- Using built-in functions like `isinstance()`, `issubclass()`, `type()`, and `super()`
- Implementing magic methods

## Files in this Project

- `0-lookup.py`: Function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object
- `1-my_list.py`: Class MyList that inherits from list
- `2-is_same_class.py`: Function to check if an object is exactly an instance of a specified class
- `3-is_kind_of_class.py`: Function to check if an object is an instance of, or inherited from, a specified class
- `4-inherits_from.py`: Function to check if an object is an instance of a class that inherited from a specified class
- `5-base_geometry.py`: Empty class BaseGeometry
- `6-base_geometry.py`: BaseGeometry class with public instance method area()
- `7-base_geometry.py`: BaseGeometry class with integer_validator method
- `8-rectangle.py`: Rectangle class that inherits from BaseGeometry
- `9-rectangle.py`: Rectangle class with area() method implemented
- `10-square.py`: Square class that inherits from Rectangle
- `11-square.py`: Square class with __str__ method implemented

## How to Use

Each file can be executed independently. For example:

```
./1-main.py
```

Make sure to have the necessary permissions to execute the files.

Python - Hello, World
This project is part of the Holberton School higher-level programming track. It consists of several Python scripts that demonstrate basic Python concepts and syntax.
Project Structure

2-print.py: Prints a specific string using the print function.
3-print_number.py: Prints an integer stored in a variable, followed by a string.
4-print_float.py: Prints a float stored in a variable with a precision of 2 digits.
5-print_string.py: Prints a string three times, followed by its first 9 characters.
6-concat.py: Concatenates strings to print a specific message.
7-edges.py: Manipulates a string to print specific parts of it.
8-concat_edges.py: Creates a new sentence from parts of an existing string.
9-easter_egg.py: Prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project contains Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts including conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## Files and Descriptions

0. **0-positive_or_negative.py**: This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

1. **1-last_digit.py**: This script assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number along with some additional information.

2. **2-print_alphabet.py**: This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

3. **3-print_alphabt.py**: This script prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', not followed by a new line.

4. **4-print_hexa.py**: This program prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.

5. **5-print_comb2.py**: This script prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by ", ".

6. **6-print_comb3.py**: This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

7. **7-islower.py**: This script contains a function that checks for lowercase characters.

8. **8-uppercase.py**: This program contains a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

9. **9-print_last_digit.py**: This script contains a function that prints the last digit of a number.

10. **10-add.py**: This program contains a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11. **11-pow.py**: This script contains a function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.

12. **12-fizzbuzz.py**: This program contains a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

## Usage

To run any of these scripts, use the following command:

```bash
./script_name.py
```

For example, to run the first script:

```bash
./0-positive_or_negative.py
```

Make sure all scripts have executable permissions. If they don't, you can add the permissions using:

```bash
chmod +x *.py
```

## Requirements

* All scripts are written in Python 3.8.5
* All scripts should end with a new line
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

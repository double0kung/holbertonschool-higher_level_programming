# Python Test-Driven Development

This project is part of the Holberton School higher-level programming track. It focuses on Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python.

## Description

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts and implementations, along with their corresponding test files. The main goal is to practice writing tests before implementing the actual functions, following the TDD approach.

## Files

* `0-add_integer.py`, `tests/0-add_integer.txt`: Function that adds two integers.
* `2-matrix_divided.py`, `tests/2-matrix_divided.txt`: Function that divides all elements of a matrix.
* `3-say_my_name.py`, `tests/3-say_my_name.txt`: Function that prints a name.
* `4-print_square.py`, `tests/4-print_square.txt`: Function that prints a square with the character #.
* `5-text_indentation.py`, `tests/5-text_indentation.txt`: Function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :
* `6-max_integer.py`, `tests/6-max_integer_test.py`: Function to find and return the max integer in a list of integers.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8.5
* pycodestyle 2.8.*
* All files must be executable
* All test files should be inside a `tests` folder
* All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)

# Python Classes Project: Square Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Square class in Python, showcasing various Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Files and Descriptions

1. `0-square.py`: Defines an empty Square class.
2. `1-square.py`: Implements a Square class with a private instance attribute `size`.
3. `2-square.py`: Extends the Square class with size validation.
4. `3-square.py`: Adds a public instance method `area()` to calculate the square area.
5. `4-square.py`: Implements property getter and setter for the `size` attribute.
6. `5-square.py`: Adds a `my_print()` method to print the square using `#` characters.
7. `6-square.py`: Extends the Square class with a `position` attribute and updates `my_print()` accordingly.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Class definition and instantiation
- Private attributes
- Getter and setter methods
- Property decorators
- Instance methods
- Input validation
- String representation of objects

## Usage

Each file can be executed independently to test its functionality. For example:

```bash
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
# ... and so on

# Python - Import & Modules

This project contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of imports and modules in Python. Each script is designed to fulfill specific requirements and showcase different aspects of working with imports and modules.

## Files

* `0-add.py`: Imports a function from another file and prints the result of addition.
* `1-calculation.py`: Imports functions from a file, performs calculations, and prints the results.
* `2-args.py`: Prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
* `3-infinite_add.py`: Prints the result of the addition of all arguments.
* `4-hidden_discovery.py`: Prints all the names defined by a compiled module.
* `5-variable_load.py`: Imports a variable from a file and prints its value.

## Requirements

* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.10.*)
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All files must be executable

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, use the following format:

```
./script_name.py
```

For example:

```
./0-add.py
```

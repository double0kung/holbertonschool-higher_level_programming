# Python ABC (Abstract Base Classes) Project

This project explores various advanced Python concepts including Abstract Base Classes (ABC), duck typing, multiple inheritance, and mixins. It's part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School.

## Project Description

The project consists of five main tasks, each focusing on different aspects of Python's object-oriented programming features:

1. Abstract Animal Class and its Subclasses
2. Shapes, Interfaces, and Duck Typing
3. Extending the Python List with Notifications
4. CountedIterator - Keeping Track of Iteration
5. The Mystical Dragon - Mastering Mixins

## Files in this Project

- `task_00_abc.py`: Implementation of abstract Animal class and its subclasses (Dog and Cat)
- `task_01_duck_typing.py`: Implementation of Shape abstract class and its subclasses (Circle and Rectangle)
- `task_02_verboselist.py`: Implementation of VerboseList class extending Python's built-in list
- `task_03_countediterator.py`: Implementation of CountedIterator class
- `task_04_flyingfish.py`: Implementation of Fish, Bird, and FlyingFish classes demonstrating multiple inheritance
- `task_05_dragon.py`: Implementation of SwimMixin, FlyMixin, and Dragon classes demonstrating the use of mixins

Each task also has a corresponding main file for testing:

- `main_00_abc.py`
- `main_01_duck_typing.py`
- `main_02_verboselist.py`
- `main_03_countediterator.py`
- `main_04_flyingfish.py`
- `main_05_dragon.py`

## How to Use

Each file can be executed independently. For example:

```
./main_00_abc.py
```

Make sure to have the necessary permissions to execute the files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5 or later
- pycodestyle 2.8.* (for style checking)

## Concepts Covered

- Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
- Duck Typing
- Multiple Inheritance
- Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Mixins
- Extending built-in classes
- Custom iterators
